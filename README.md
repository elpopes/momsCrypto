# momsCrypto: A Crypto Tracker for Mom

Welcome to momsCrypto, the only cryptocurrency tracker designed by a loving child for their mom. Tired of sending those late quarterly reports on how Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing? Say no more. momsCrypto is here to make everyone's lives easier (and to save me from the never-ending tech support calls).

## Why momsCrypto?

My mom, like many, ventured into the cryptosphere with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. After the initial investment, she had one simple request: "Keep me updated on how it's doing, will you?" Little did I know, this meant quarterly reports, panic-induced phone calls during market dips, and a crash course in explaining blockchain over Sunday dinner.

momsCrypto aims to solve this by offering a simple, accessible way to track the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum investments without needing a finance degree or a hotline to your tech-savvy family member.

## Features

- **Dynamic Line Graph**: See the value of your investment over time with the ability to zoom in on specific periods—last day, week, month, year, or all-time.
- **Fixed Investment Time and Fees**: Calculations include a fixed .5 percent fee, making it straightforward to see net gains or losses.
- **Customizable Timeframe**: Input the date of your initial investment to personalize your tracking experience.
- **Mildly Quirky Interface**: Because finance doesn't have to be boring or overly complicated.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser, and you're good to go! No installation, no fuss. Just pure, simple crypto tracking.

## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Cryptocurrency**: Select Bitcoin or Ethereum to start tracking.
2. **Set Your Investment Date**: Use the handy date picker to choose when you (or your mom) made the initial investment.
3. **Observe and Relax**: Watch the dynamic line graph update with real-time data. Zoom in on specific periods to see detailed performance.
